# Modeling Asset Pricing via SDEs

Final project on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) applied to asset pricing.

## 📈 Overview

We model asset price dynamics using SDEs to capture stochastic behavior in:
- **Asset price** S(t)
- **Interest rate** I(t)
- **Volatility** σ(t)

Theoretical properties (e.g., martingales, positivity, mean reversion) are studied, followed by numerical validation via:
- **Euler-Maruyama** and **stochastic θ-method**
- **Monte Carlo simulations** in MATLAB

## 🧪 Key Topics

- Analytical solutions for constant and time-varying coefficients
- Positivity and stationarity of interest rate and volatility models
- Strong/weak convergence of discretization schemes
- Impact of discretization and MC variance on error
- Comparison of Lamperti vs θ-method for volatility modeling

## 🔧 Tools

- MATLAB for simulations
- Monte Carlo for expectation estimation
- Ito’s lemma, Fokker-Planck, Law of Iterated Logarithm
